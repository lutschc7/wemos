Using the WeMos D1 Mini's "5V" pin:
  This pin pulls power from the USB's 5V pin.
  This pin can safely provide at least 700mA.
  Too much current draw (i.e. hooking up a servo motor or other high current device) will cause the WeMos PCB traces to smoke (not good!)
  So, limit the current through the 5V pin either before the USB input or after the 5V pin.

Errors when trying to upload. 
  Certain pins on the WeMos cannot be connected while trying to upload.
  Try unplugging the GPIO pins or switching them to different pins.
